Representation of quantities with SI units.

The package is written with flexibility in mind and is able to represent arbitrarily complex units.
In addition to simple scalar quantities, it can be used to decorate any complex data type (numpy arrays, PyTorch tensors) to provide unit checks.

## Installation and Usage

You can install the package from PyPI

```
pip install si-units
```

For the documentation, see [here](https://itt-ustutt.github.io/quantity/index.html).

To build the wheel or documentation locally, see below.

## Examples

Calculate the pressure of an ideal gas.

```python
from si_units import *
temperature = 25.0 * CELSIUS
volume = 1.5 * METER**3
moles = 75.0 * MOL
pressure = moles * RGAS * temperature / volume
print(pressure) # 123.94785148011941 kPa
```

`numpy` functions can be used with SI units:

```python
from si_units import *
import numpy as np
ms = np.linspace(2.0, 4.0, 3) * METER
sqms = ms**2
print(sqms) # [4, 9, 16] mÂ²
```

## Building from Source

You need a rust compiler to build the wheel locally.
To build the bindings to python, we use [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin).

Use

``` bash
# in si-units
maturin develop --release
```

to build the package locally.

To build the python wheels, use

```bash
maturin build --release
```

## Building the Documentation

To build the documentation you need `mkdocs-material` and `mkdocstrings-python`. Installing these packages (e.g. using `uv` or `pip`) will also install the needed dependencies. 
During development, use

```bash
# in si-units
mkdocs serve
```

to run a local development server.

To build the documentation for deployment, use

```bash
# in si-units
mkdocs build
```
